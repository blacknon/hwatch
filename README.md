## Configuration

If you always want to use some command-line options, you can set them in the
`HWATCH` environment variable. For example, if you use `bash`, you can add
the following to your `.bashrc`:

```bash
export HWATCH="--no-title --color --no-help-banner --border --with-scrollbar"
```

## Execution environment

When running a command, `hwatch` sets the `COLUMNS`. Many commands recognize it
automatically (try `git diff --stat`), some others accept column width as a
command-line argument.

TODO: Link to standard.

Some versions of `bash` might reset the value of `COLUMNS`; for this reason the `HWATCH_COLUMNS` environment variable is set to the same value.

## Example

### interval 3 second

Use the -n option to specify the command execution interval.

```bash
hwatch -n 3 command...
```

### logging output

The command execution result can be output as a log in json format.

```bash
hwatch -n 3 -l hwatch_log.json command...
```

When you check the json log, you can easily check it by using [this script](https://gist.github.com/blacknon/551e52dce1651d2510162def5a0da1f0).

### Use shell function

If you want the shell function to be executed periodically, you can specify the shell command to be executed with -s as follows.

```bash
# bash
hwatch -n 3 -s 'bash -c "source ~/.bashrc"; {COMMAND}' command...

# zsh
hwatch -n 3 -s 'zsh -c "source ~/.zshrc"; {COMMAND}' command...
```

### ANSI Color code

If you want to see output colored with ANSI color code, enable color mode.

To enable color mode, run hwatch with the `-c` option.
Alternatively, you can enable / disable the color mode with the <kbd>C</kbd> key during execution.

```bash
hwatch -n 3 -c command...
```

### diff view

To enable color mode, run hwatch with the `-d` option.

There are several "diff modes" available.
Switching can be done with the <kbd>D</kbd> key.

```bash
hwatch -n 3 -d command...
```

#### watch diff

<p align="center">
<img src="./img/watch_diff.jpg" />
</p>

#### line diff

<p align="center">
<img src="./img/line_diff.jpg" />
</p>

#### word diff

<p align="center">
<img src="./img/word_diff.jpg" />
</p>

### history filtering

You can filter history as a string with <kbd>/</kbd> key and as a regular expression with <kbd>*</kbd> key.

### run batch mode

You can have command diffs output directly to stdout instead with `-b` option of getting them as a TUI app.

```bash
hwatch -b command...
```
